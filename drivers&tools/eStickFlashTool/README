eStick USB Device Driver Installation
-------------------------------------

Following this installation of the eStickFlashtool the next steps are
the installation and registration of the libusb driver in order to 
enable communication between the eStickFlashtool on the PC under 
MS Windows and the AT90USB162 microcontroller on the eStick. Therefore,
carefully follow the next steps:

1) Hold the button on the eStick pressed while plugging the eStick to
one of the available USB ports on your computer. The device manager
launches and notifies you in the system tray at the right bottom of your
desktop that a new device has been found.

2) In the welcome dialog of the device driver wizard select the first
item "Yes, only this time (Ja, nur dieses eine Mal)" and click on 
"Next > (Weiter >)".

3) In the following dialog choose the second item "Install software from
a list ... (Software von einer Liste oder betsimmten Quelle 
installieren ...)" and click "Next > (Weiter >)".

4) In the third dialog window point the wizard to the directory where 
you have installed the eStickFlashtool, in particular, to the driver
subdirectory, e.g.: "C:\eStick\eStickFlashtool\driver".

5) The wizard will complain in the final dialog, that the driver does
not come along with a signature from Microsoft. You may safely ignore
this complaint, select "eStick" and click on "Next > (Weiter >)". The 
driver will be installed.

6) Launch the eStickFlashtool via the menu, select from the menu "File"
>> "Open" and choose a *.hex file from the "hexfiles" subfolder, e.g.
"C:\eStick\eStickFlashtool\hexfiles\blinky.hex". Leave the "Erase, 
Program and Verify" items in the right pane marked and click on FLASH.
When everything works as intended you should see a message "Verify 
successful ..." in the status bar.

7) Click the START button to start the application that was programmed 
to the eStick. When you have choosen blinky.hex before one Led shall 
blink. YOu may unplug the eStick from the USB port and power it via a 
9V battery block or re-plug it to the USB port once more, this time,
however without holding the button pressed. As soon as the eStick gets
it's power supply the programmed appplication will execute.

Every time you want to program/flash a new application to the eStick
unplug and re-plug the eStick while holding the button pressed and 
perform the above steps 6 and 7.
